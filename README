SHEAR: Simple Handler for Error and Adapter Removal

This program provides an integrated system to trim and filter Illumina short reads. 
Barcode-customized adapter tags are prepared for removal by Scythe (https://github.com/vsbuffalo/scythe),
then reads are filtered by length, quality scores, and in the case of highly repetition of sequence.
This provides a quick, integrated, and installation-free method to reduce error in your Illumina short reads.
You can also skip Scythe and use your own adapter trimmer, but still use SHEAR for all other trimming.

Key features:
- Simultaneous pair trimming and discarding of orphaned reads (i.e. the other pair of a filtered read). 
- Poly-A and Poly-T tail trimming (good for RNA-Seq)
- Removes dinucleotide repeat reads.
- Automatically builds your adapter sequences with custom barcodes from your samples.
