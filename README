SHEAR: Simple Handler for Error and Adapter Removal

This program provides an integrated system to trim and filter Illumina short reads. 
Barcode-customized adapter tags are prepared for removal by Scythe (https://github.com/vsbuffalo/scythe),
then reads are filtered by length, quality scores, and in the case of highly repetition of sequence.
This provides a quick, integrated, and installation-free method to reduce error in your Illumina short reads.
You can also skip Scythe and use your own adapter trimmer, but still use SHEAR for all other trimming.
